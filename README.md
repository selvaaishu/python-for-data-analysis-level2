📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas & Matplotlib

🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed using Python. The analysis focuses on understanding datasets, summarizing key statistics, and visualizing patterns using Pandas and Matplotlib.

In this project, I worked with:

A Movies dataset for real-world data analysis

A custom Country dataset created manually for practice



---

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📁 Datasets Used

🎬 Movies Dataset

The movies dataset contains information such as:

Movie name

Ratings

Genre

Release year (if applicable)


This dataset was used to understand real-world data structure and trends.

🌍 Country Dataset (Custom)

A small dataset created manually containing country-related details such as:

Country name

Population / GDP / other attributes


This dataset was used to practice data creation, manipulation, and visualization.

🔎 EDA Steps Performed

📌 Data Exploration

The following Pandas functions were used:

head() – to view the first few rows

tail() – to view the last few rows

info() – to understand data types and missing values

describe() – to generate statistical summaries


📌 Data Manipulation

Created new columns

Worked with both existing and custom datasets

Performed basic analysis on numerical and categorical data



---

📊 Data Visualization

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib.

Movies Dataset Visualizations:

Distribution of movie ratings

Comparison across categories / years


Country Dataset Visualizations:

Country-wise comparison using bar charts

Simple plots to understand differences between values
